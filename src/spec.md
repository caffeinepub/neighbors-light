# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make `referral_review_status` the first field shown on the Staff/Admin Referral review screen.

**Planned changes:**
- Reorder the Referral review screen layout so the existing `referral_review_status` field/section is rendered at the very top of the review content area.
- Keep all existing fields, data, and behavior unchanged (no new fields, no logic or backend changes).

**User-visible outcome:** Staff/Admin users see `referral_review_status` at the top of the Referral review screen before any other referral fields/sections.
