  "summary": "REQ-79 appears satisfied in the visible portion of the diff: `website` is added to component state but is not used for validation, branching, or submission payload. REQ-78 cannot be fully verified from the truncated diff because the actual rendered input/label placement and `id=\"website\"` are not shown. Additional non-requested metadata/state files were modified.",

      "id": "REQ-78",
      "requirement": "Render a visible text input field named `website` with label exactly “Website (leave blank)”, with `id=\"website\"`, placed at the bottom of the form and visually unobtrusive, and ensure no other honeypot/spam fields are present on this page.",
      "reason": "The diff shows `website` state was added, but the truncated file content does not include the JSX that renders the `website` input/label, its `id`, or its placement at the bottom of the form. The diff also does not provide enough evidence to confirm the absence of other honeypot/spam fields on the page.",
