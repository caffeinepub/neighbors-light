  "summary": "REQ-81 appears to be implemented in that `referral_review_status` is described as being displayed first at the top of the referral detail/review UI. However, the diff also introduces new UI and logic around a \"Referral Review Status\" dropdown (including new types and helper functions), which goes beyond the request/constraints (reorder only; no new fields/logic). Additionally, meta/documentation files were updated that were not requested.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest requires only reordering the existing field/section and explicitly forbids adding new fields. The diff summary describes adding a dropdown selector UI (\"UI ready, pending backend integration\").",
