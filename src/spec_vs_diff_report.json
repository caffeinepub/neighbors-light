  "summary": "The diff adds a dedicated referral filtering utility (status + program + submission date range with AND logic and inclusive date boundaries) and begins integrating it into the ReferralsTab via new filter state and imports. Based on the truncated ReferralsTab diff, the core filtering logic is implemented, but the UI wiring (rendering the controls, applying filtered results to the displayed list, and ensuring the explicit 'All programs' option is shown) cannot be fully confirmed from the provided snippet.",
